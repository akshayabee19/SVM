Support Vector Machines with scikit-learn: This project mainly deals with the visual implementation of SVM with scikit-learn using python. 
Objectives: 
1.Understand the theory behind support vector machines.
2.Builld SVM models with scikit-learn to classify linear and non-linear data.
3.Determine the strengths and limitations of SVMs.
4.Develop an SVM-based facial recognition model.
