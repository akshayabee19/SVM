Support Vector Machines with scikit-learn: This project mainly deals with the visual implementation of SVM with scikit-learn using python. 
Objectives: 
1.To nderstand the theory behind support vector machines.
2.To build SVM models with scikit-learn to classify linear and non-linear data.
3.To determine the strengths and limitations of SVMs
4.To develop a digit recognition model.
5.To develop an SVM-based facial recognition model.
